This repository contains the practical exercises developed as part of the Text Mining and Social Networks modules of the 2022-2023 course. The purpose of these exercises is to apply the theoretical knowledge learned in class by working with real datasets related to text classification and social network analysis.

Contents
Exercise 1: Text Mining (Tweet Classification)
Objective: Perform exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and classification modeling on a dataset of Spanish tweets.

Dataset: Tweets labeled according to the presence or absence of professional mentions (ProfNER Shared Task 2021).

Tasks include:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) including document counts, distribution visualizations, word clouds, etc.

Text preprocessing (stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, lemmatization/stemming).

Text vectorization using TF-IDF or word embeddings, with optional sentiment features for TF-IDF models.

Training and evaluating at least three classification models with hyperparameter tuning.

Exercise 2: Social Networks (Twitter Health Network Analysis)
Objective: Analyze a Twitter followers network related to health domain accounts.

Dataset: Nodes and edges extracted from Twitter followers of seed health accounts.

Tasks include:

Loading and topological analysis of the network (nodes, edges, user connectivity).

Connectivity and shortest path distributions.

Node relevance metrics: closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, PageRank.

Visualization of the network with NetworkX and/or Gephi using modularity classes and PageRank metrics.
